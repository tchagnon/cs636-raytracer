# cs636-raytracer

Raytracer for Drexel CS636 class written in Haskell

This package was written for the Spring 2009 [CS636 Advanced Rendering
Techniques][class] class at Drexel University, taught by David Breen.  I am
posting it here in its original form with original git history.  Each assignment
code is in a separate directory and builds on the previous assignments.  The
[class web page][class] has all the assignment requirement details, lectures and
background information.

Each assignment directory (a1-a6) has its own simple Makefile build and README.
