DESCRIPTION
    This program takes a scene description with spheres and meshes and renders
    the scene to PPM image format.  The program is written in Haskell.

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
    vim
    GHC         6.10.1
    GNU Make    3.81-3build1
    Ubuntu      8.04 (x86_64)

FILES

  Scenes:
    scene0.hs               Trefoil of spheres, bunny, cow, teapot.

  New Code:
    RayTracer.hs            Additional code for shadows, reflections
                            Lines: 145-186
                            In existing functions: getColor, diffSpec
    Primitive.hs            Added Plane

  Core Code:
    RayTracer.hs            Top level ray tracing logic
    Scene.hs                Scene description objects
    Mesh.hs                 Triangle mesh code
    Primitive.hs            Primitive shapes
    Bounding.hs             BoundingBox data structure and functions
    Object.hs               Heirarchical Object Tree
    Ray.hs                  Ray object
    Math.hs                 Linear Algebra directly implemented
    Image.hs                Writing to PPM
    Color.hs                Colors
    Material.hs             Material type

    README
    Makefile

COMPILING
    $ make
        Builds scene executables

    $ make test
        Renders all scenes, displays PPM files via ImageMagick display command.

    $ make clean
        Removes all built files
